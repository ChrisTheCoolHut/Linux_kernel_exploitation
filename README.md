# Resources for x86_64 Linux Kernel Exploitation

On ubuntu you will need QEMU:
```bash
sudo apt install qemu-system qemu-system-x86

```

After that you should be able to launch the kernel immediatly with either

```
$ ./launch.sh
$ ./launch_stack_cookie.sh
```


Thanks to [pwn.college](pwn.college) for their kernel and resources!
