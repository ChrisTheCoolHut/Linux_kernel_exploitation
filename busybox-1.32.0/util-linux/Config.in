	bool "acpid (9 kb)"
	default y
	select PLATFORM_LINUX
	help
	acpid listens to ACPI events coming either in textual form from
	/proc/acpi/event (though it is marked deprecated it is still widely
	used and _is_ a standard) or in binary form from specified evdevs
	(just use /dev/input/event*).

	It parses the event to retrieve ACTION and a possible PARAMETER.
	It then spawns /etc/acpi/<ACTION>[/<PARAMETER>] either via run-parts
	(if the resulting path is a directory) or directly as an executable.

	N.B. acpid relies on run-parts so have the latter installed.

	help
	fdformat is used to low-level format a floppy disk.
config FDISK
	bool "fdisk (37 kb)"
	default y
	select PLATFORM_LINUX
	help
	The fdisk utility is used to divide hard disks into one or more
	logical disks, which are generally called partitions. This utility

	disabled, you will only be able to view the partition table.

config FEATURE_AIX_LABEL
	bool "Support AIX disklabels"
	default n
	depends on FDISK && FEATURE_FDISK_WRITABLE
	help
	Enabling this option allows you to create or change AIX disklabels.

	bool "fdflush (1.3 kb)"
	default y
	select PLATFORM_LINUX
	help
	fdflush is only needed when changing media on slightly-broken
	removable media drives. It is used to make Linux believe that a
	hardware disk-change switch has been actuated, which causes Linux to
	forget anything it has cached from the previous media. If you have
	such a slightly-broken drive, you will need to run fdflush every time
	you change a disk. Most people have working hardware and can safely
	leave this disabled.

config FREERAMDISK
	bool "freeramdisk (1.3 kb)"
	default y
	select PLATFORM_LINUX
	help
	Linux allows you to create ramdisks. This utility allows you to
	delete them and completely free all memory that was used for the
	ramdisk. For example, if you boot Linux into a ramdisk and later
	pivot_root, you may want to free the memory that is allocated to the
	ramdisk. If you have no use for freeing memory from a ramdisk, leave
	this disabled.
config FSCK_MINIX
	bool "fsck.minix (13 kb)"
	default y
	help
	The minix filesystem is a nice, small, compact, read-write filesystem
	with little overhead. It is not a journaling filesystem however and
	can experience corruption if it is not properly unmounted or if the
	power goes off in the middle of a write. This utility allows you to
	check for and attempt to repair any corruption that occurs to a minix
	filesystem.
config FSFREEZE
	bool "fsfreeze (3.5 kb)"
	default y
	select PLATFORM_LINUX
	select LONG_OPTS

	select PLATFORM_LINUX
	help
	Discard unused blocks on a mounted filesystem.
config GETOPT
	bool "getopt (5.8 kb)"
	default y
	help
	The getopt utility is used to break up (parse) options in command
	lines to make it easy to write complex shell scripts that also check
	for legal (and illegal) options. If you want to write horribly
	complex shell scripts, or use some horribly complex shell script
	written by others, this utility may be for you. Most people will
	wisely leave this disabled.

config FEATURE_GETOPT_LONG
	bool "Support -l LONGOPTs"
	default y
	depends on GETOPT && LONG_OPTS
	help
	Enable support for long options (option -l).

	way that is comparable to the output from most hex editors.
config HWCLOCK
	bool "hwclock (5.8 kb)"
	default y
	select PLATFORM_LINUX
	help
	The hwclock utility is used to read and set the hardware clock
	on a system. This is primarily used to set the current time on
	shutdown in the hardware clock, so the hardware will keep the
	correct time when Linux is _not_ running.

config FEATURE_HWCLOCK_ADJTIME_FHS
	bool "Use FHS /var/lib/hwclock/adjtime"
	default n  # util-linux-ng in Fedora 13 still uses /etc/adjtime
	depends on HWCLOCK
	help
	Starting with FHS 2.3, the adjtime state file is supposed to exist
	at /var/lib/hwclock/adjtime instead of /etc/adjtime. If you wish
	to use the FHS behavior, answer Y here, otherwise answer N for the
	classic /etc/adjtime path.

config FEATURE_MDEV_LOAD_FIRMWARE
	bool "Support loading of firmware"
	default y
	depends on MDEV
	help
	Some devices need to load firmware before they can be usable.

	These devices will request userspace look up the files in
	/lib/firmware/ and if it exists, send it to the kernel for
	loading into the hardware.

config FEATURE_MDEV_DAEMON
	bool "Support daemon mode"
	default y
	depends on MDEV
	help
	Adds the -d option to run mdev in daemon mode handling hotplug
	events from the kernel like udev. If the system generates many
	hotplug events this mode of operation will consume less
	resources than registering mdev as hotplug helper or using the
	uevent applet.
config MESG
	bool "mesg (1.4 kb)"
	default y
	help
	Mesg controls access to your terminal by others. It is typically
	used to allow or disallow other users to write to your terminal

config FEATURE_MESG_ENABLE_ONLY_GROUP
	bool "Enable writing to tty only by group, not by everybody"
	default y
	depends on MESG
	help
	Usually, ttys are owned by group "tty", and "write" tool is
	setgid to this group. This way, "mesg y" only needs to enable
	"write by owning group" bit in tty mode.

	If you set this option to N, "mesg y" will enable writing
	by anybody at all. This is not recommended.
config MKE2FS
	bool "mke2fs (10 kb)"
	default y
	select PLATFORM_LINUX
	help
	Utility to create EXT2 filesystems.

	The minix filesystem is a nice, small, compact, read-write filesystem
	with little overhead. If you wish to be able to create minix
	filesystems this utility will do the job for you.

config FEATURE_MINIX2
	bool "Support Minix fs v2 (fsck_minix/mkfs_minix)"
	default y
	depends on FSCK_MINIX || MKFS_MINIX
	help
	If you wish to be able to create version 2 minix filesystems, enable
	this. If you enabled 'mkfs_minix' then you almost certainly want to
	be using the version 2 filesystem support.
config MKFS_REISER

	help
	Alias to "mkdosfs".
config MKSWAP
	bool "mkswap (6.3 kb)"
	default y
	help
	The mkswap utility is used to configure a file or disk partition as
	Linux swap space. This allows Linux to use the entire file or
	partition as if it were additional RAM, which can greatly increase
	the capability of low-memory machines. This additional memory is
	much slower than real RAM, but can be very helpful at preventing your
	applications being killed by the Linux out of memory (OOM) killer.
	Once you have created swap space using 'mkswap' you need to enable
	the swap space using the 'swapon' utility.

config FEATURE_MKSWAP_UUID
	bool "UUID support"
	default y
	depends on MKSWAP
	help
	Generate swap spaces with universally unique identifiers.
config MORE
	bool "more (7 kb)"
	default y
	help
	more is a simple utility which allows you to read text one screen
	sized page at a time. If you want to read text that is larger than
	the screen, and you are using anything faster than a 300 baud modem,
	you will probably find this utility very helpful. If you don't have
	any need to reading text files, you can leave this disabled.
config MOUNT
	bool "mount (23 kb)"
	default y
	select PLATFORM_LINUX
	help
	All files and filesystems in Unix are arranged into one big directory
	tree. The 'mount' utility is used to graft a filesystem onto a
	particular part of the tree. A filesystem can either live on a block
	device, or it can be accessible over the network, as is the case with
	NFS filesystems.

config FEATURE_MOUNT_FAKE
	bool "Support -f (fake mount)"
	default y
	depends on MOUNT
	help
	Enable support for faking a file system mount.

config FEATURE_MOUNT_VERBOSE

	debug mount problems and want to see what is exactly passed
	to the kernel.

config FEATURE_MOUNT_HELPERS
	bool "Support mount helpers"
	default n
	depends on MOUNT
	help
	Enable mounting of virtual file systems via external helpers.
	E.g. "mount obexfs#-b00.11.22.33.44.55 /mnt" will in effect call
	"obexfs -b00.11.22.33.44.55 /mnt"
	Also "mount -t sometype [-o opts] fs /mnt" will try
	"sometype [-o opts] fs /mnt" if simple mount syscall fails.
	The idea is to use such virtual filesystems in /etc/fstab.

config FEATURE_MOUNT_LABEL
	bool "Support specifying devices by label or UUID"
	default y
	depends on MOUNT
	select VOLUMEID
	help
	This allows for specifying a device by label or uuid, rather than by
	name. This feature utilizes the same functionality as blkid/findfs.

	bool "Support mounting NFS file systems on Linux < 2.6.23"
	default n
	depends on MOUNT
	select FEATURE_SYSLOG
	help
	Enable mounting of NFS file systems on Linux kernels prior
	to version 2.6.23. Note that in this case mounting of NFS
	over IPv6 will not be possible.

	Note that this option links in RPC support from libc,
	which is rather large (~10 kbytes on uclibc).

config FEATURE_MOUNT_CIFS
	bool "Support mounting CIFS/SMB file systems"
	default y
	depends on MOUNT
	help
	Enable support for samba mounts.

config FEATURE_MOUNT_FLAGS
	depends on MOUNT
	bool "Support lots of -o flags"

	nologin is implemented as a shell script. It requires the
	following in the runtime environment:
		cat echo sleep
	If you know these will be available externally you can
	disable this option.

	help
	Run program with namespaces of other processes.
config PIVOT_ROOT
	bool "pivot_root (1.1 kb)"
	default y
	select PLATFORM_LINUX
	help
	The pivot_root utility swaps the mount points for the root filesystem
	with some other mounted filesystem. This allows you to do all sorts
	of wild and crazy things with your Linux system and is far more
	powerful than 'chroot'.

	Note: This is for initrd in linux 2.4. Under initramfs (introduced
	in linux 2.6) use switch_root instead.
config RDATE
	bool "rdate (5.6 kb)"
	default y
	help
	The rdate utility allows you to synchronize the date and time of your
	system clock with the date and time of a remote networked system using

	help
	This program replays a typescript, using timing information
	given by script -t.
config SETARCH
	bool "setarch (3.6 kb)"
	default y
	select PLATFORM_LINUX
	help
	The linux32 utility is used to create a 32bit environment for the
	specified program (usually a shell). It only makes sense to have
	this util on a system that supports both 64bit and 32bit userland
	(like amd64/x86, ppc64/ppc, sparc64/sparc, etc...).

config LINUX32

	Enables the "--dump" switch to print out the current privilege
	state. This is helpful for diagnosing problems.

config FEATURE_SETPRIV_CAPABILITIES
	bool "Support capabilities"
	default y
	depends on SETPRIV
	help
	Capabilities can be used to grant processes additional rights
	without the necessity to always execute as the root user.
	Enabling this option enables "--dump" to show information on
	capabilities.

config FEATURE_SETPRIV_CAPABILITY_NAMES
	bool "Support capability names"
	default y
	depends on SETPRIV && FEATURE_SETPRIV_CAPABILITIES
	help
	Capabilities can be either referenced via a human-readble name,
	e.g. "net_admin", or using their index, e.g. "cap_12". Enabling
	this option allows using the human-readable names in addition to
	the index-based names.
config SETSID
	bool "setsid (3.6 kb)"
	default y
	help
	setsid runs a program in a new session
config SWAPON
	bool "swapon (15 kb)"
	default y
	select PLATFORM_LINUX
	help
	Once you have created some swap space using 'mkswap', you also need
	to enable your swap space with the 'swapon' utility. The 'swapoff'
	utility is used, typically at system shutdown, to disable any swap
	space. If you are not using any swap space, you can leave this
	option disabled.

config FEATURE_SWAPON_DISCARD
	bool "Support discard option -d"
	default y
	depends on SWAPON
	help
	Enable support for discarding swap area blocks at swapon and/or as
	the kernel frees them. This option enables both the -d option on
	'swapon' and the 'discard' option for swap entries in /etc/fstab.

config FEATURE_SWAPON_PRI
	bool "Support priority option -p"
	default y
	depends on SWAPON
	help
	Enable support for setting swap device priority in swapon.

config SWAPOFF

config FEATURE_SWAPONOFF_LABEL
	bool "Support specifying devices by label or UUID"
	default y
	depends on SWAPON || SWAPOFF
	select VOLUMEID
	help
	This allows for specifying a device by label or uuid, rather than by
	name. This feature utilizes the same functionality as blkid/findfs.
config SWITCH_ROOT
	bool "switch_root (5.5 kb)"
	default y
	select PLATFORM_LINUX
	help
	The switch_root utility is used from initramfs to select a new
	root device. Under initramfs, you have to use this instead of
	pivot_root. (Stop reading here if you don't care why.)

	Booting with initramfs extracts a gzipped cpio archive into rootfs
	(which is a variant of ramfs/tmpfs). Because rootfs can't be moved
	or unmounted*, pivot_root will not work from initramfs. Instead,
	switch_root deletes everything out of rootfs (including itself),
	does a mount --move that overmounts rootfs with the new root, and
	then execs the specified init program.

	* Because the Linux kernel uses rootfs internally as the starting
	and ending point for searching through the kernel's doubly linked
	list of active mount points. That's why.

config TASKSET
	bool "taskset (4.2 kb)"
	default y
	help
	Retrieve or set a processes's CPU affinity.
	This requires sched_{g,s}etaffinity support in your libc.

config FEATURE_TASKSET_FANCY
	bool "Fancy output"
	default y
	depends on TASKSET
	help
	Needed for machines with more than 32-64 CPUs:
	affinity parameter 0xHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH can be arbitrarily long
	in this case. Otherwise, it is limited to sizeof(long).

config FEATURE_TASKSET_CPULIST
	bool "CPU list support (-c option)"
	default y
	depends on FEATURE_TASKSET_FANCY
	help
	Add support for taking/printing affinity as CPU list when '-c'
	option is used. For example, it prints '0-3,7' instead of mask '8f'.
config UEVENT
	bool "uevent (3.1 kb)"
	default y
	select PLATFORM_LINUX
	help
	uevent is a netlink listener for kernel uevent notifications
	sent via netlink. It is usually used for dynamic device creation.
config UMOUNT
	bool "umount (5.1 kb)"
	default y
	select PLATFORM_LINUX
	help
	When you want to remove a mounted filesystem from its current mount
	point, for example when you are shutting down the system, the
	'umount' utility is the tool to use. If you enabled the 'mount'
	utility, you almost certainly also want to enable 'umount'.

config FEATURE_UMOUNT_ALL
	bool "Support -a (unmount all)"
	default y
	depends on UMOUNT
	help
	Support -a option to unmount all currently mounted filesystems.
config UNSHARE

config FEATURE_MOUNT_LOOP
	bool "Support loopback mounts"
	default y
	depends on MOUNT || UMOUNT
	help
	Enabling this feature allows automatic mounting of files (containing
	filesystem images) via the linux kernel's loopback devices.
	The mount command will detect you are trying to mount a file instead
	of a block device, and transparently associate the file with a
	loopback device. The umount command will also free that loopback
	device.

	You can still use the 'losetup' utility (to manually associate files
	with loop devices) if you need to do something advanced, such as
	specify an offset or cryptographic options to the loopback device.
	(If you don't want umount to free the loop device, use "umount -D".)

config FEATURE_MOUNT_LOOP_CREATE
	bool "Create new loopback devices if needed"
	default y
	depends on FEATURE_MOUNT_LOOP
	help
	Linux kernels >= 2.6.24 support unlimited loopback devices. They are
	allocated for use when trying to use a loop device. The loop device
	must however exist.

	This feature lets mount to try to create next /dev/loopN device
	if it does not find a free one.

config FEATURE_MTAB_SUPPORT
	bool "Support old /etc/mtab file"
	default n
	depends on MOUNT || UMOUNT
	select FEATURE_MOUNT_FAKE
	help
	Historically, Unix systems kept track of the currently mounted
	partitions in the file "/etc/mtab". These days, the kernel exports
	the list of currently mounted partitions in "/proc/mounts", rendering
	the old mtab file obsolete. (In modern systems, /etc/mtab should be
	a symlink to /proc/mounts.)

	The only reason to have mount maintain an /etc/mtab file itself is if
	your stripped-down embedded system does not have a /proc directory.
	If you must use this, keep in mind it's inherently brittle (for
	example a mount under chroot won't update it), can't handle modern
	features like separate per-process filesystem namespaces, requires
	that your /etc directory be writable, tends to get easily confused
	by --bind or --move mounts, won't update if you rename a directory
	that contains a mount point, and so on. (In brief: avoid.)

	About the only reason to use this is if you've removed /proc from
	your kernel.
