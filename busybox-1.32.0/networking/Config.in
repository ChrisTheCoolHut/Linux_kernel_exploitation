config FEATURE_IPV6
	bool "Enable IPv6 support"
	default y
	help
	Enable IPv6 support in busybox.
	This adds IPv6 support in the networking applets.

config FEATURE_UNIX_LOCAL
	bool "Enable Unix domain socket support (usually not needed)"
	default n
	help
	Enable Unix domain socket support in all busybox networking
	applets.  Address of the form local:/path/to/unix/socket
	will be recognized.

	This extension is almost never used in real world usage.
	You most likely want to say N.

config FEATURE_PREFER_IPV4_ADDRESS
	bool "Prefer IPv4 addresses from DNS queries"
	default y
	depends on FEATURE_IPV6
	help
	Use IPv4 address of network host if it has one.

	If this option is off, the first returned address will be used.
	This may cause problems when your DNS server is IPv6-capable and
	is returning IPv6 host addresses too. If IPv6 address
	precedes IPv4 one in DNS reply, busybox network applets
	(e.g. wget) will use IPv6 address. On an IPv6-incapable host
	or network applets will fail to connect to the host
	using IPv6 address.

config VERBOSE_RESOLUTION_ERRORS
	bool "Verbose resolution errors"
	default n
	help
	Enable if you are not satisfied with simplistic
	"can't resolve 'hostname.com'" and want to know more.
	This may increase size of your executable a bit.

config FEATURE_TLS_SHA1
	bool "In TLS code, support ciphers which use deprecated SHA1"
	depends on TLS
	default n
	help
	Selecting this option increases interoperability with very old
	servers, but slightly increases code size.

	Most TLS servers support SHA256 today (2018), since SHA1 is
	considered possibly insecure (although not yet definitely broken).

config ARP
	bool "arp (10 kb)"
	default y
	select PLATFORM_LINUX
	help
	Manipulate the system ARP cache.
config ARPING
	bool "arping (9 kb)"
	default y
	select PLATFORM_LINUX
	help
	Ping hosts by ARP packets.
config BRCTL
	bool "brctl (4.7 kb)"
	default y
	select PLATFORM_LINUX
	help
	Manage ethernet bridges.
	Supports addbr/delbr and addif/delif.

config FEATURE_BRCTL_FANCY
	bool "Fancy options"
	default y
	depends on BRCTL
	help
	Add support for extended option like:
		setageing, setfd, sethello, setmaxage,
		setpathcost, setportprio, setbridgeprio,
		stp
	This adds about 600 bytes.

config FEATURE_BRCTL_SHOW
	bool "Support show"
	default y
	depends on BRCTL && FEATURE_BRCTL_FANCY
	help
	Add support for option which prints the current config:
		show
config DNSD
	bool "dnsd (9.8 kb)"

config FEATURE_FTPD_WRITE
	bool "Enable -w (upload commands)"
	default y
	depends on FTPD
	help
	Enable -w option. "ftpd -w" will accept upload commands
	such as STOR, STOU, APPE, DELE, MKD, RMD, rename commands.

config FEATURE_FTPD_ACCEPT_BROKEN_LIST
	bool "Enable workaround for RFC-violating clients"
	default y
	depends on FTPD
	help
	Some ftp clients (among them KDE's Konqueror) issue illegal
	"LIST -l" requests. This option works around such problems.
	It might prevent you from listing files starting with "-" and
	it increases the code size by ~40 bytes.
	Most other ftp servers seem to behave similar to this.

config FEATURE_FTPD_AUTHENTICATION
	bool "Enable authentication"
	default y
	depends on FTPD
	help
	Require login, and change to logged in user's UID:GID before
	accessing any files. Option "-a USER" allows "anonymous"
	logins (treats them as if USER logged in).

	If this option is not selected, ftpd runs with the rights
	of the user it was started under, and does not require login.
	Take care to not launch it under root.
config FTPGET
	bool "ftpget (7.8 kb)"
	default y
	help
	Retrieve a remote file via FTP.

config FTPPUT
	bool "ftpput (7.5 kb)"
	default y
	help
	Store a remote file via FTP.

config FEATURE_FTPGETPUT_LONG_OPTIONS
	bool "Enable long options in ftpget/ftpput"
	default y
	depends on LONG_OPTS && (FTPGET || FTPPUT)

	bool "Support 'Ranges:' header"
	default y
	depends on HTTPD
	help
	Makes httpd emit "Accept-Ranges: bytes" header and understand
	"Range: bytes=NNN-[MMM]" header. Allows for resuming interrupted
	downloads, seeking in multimedia players etc.

config FEATURE_HTTPD_SETUID
	bool "Enable -u <user> option"
	default y
	depends on HTTPD
	help
	This option allows the server to run as a specific user
	rather than defaulting to the user that starts the server.
	Use of this option requires special privileges to change to a
	different user.

config FEATURE_HTTPD_BASIC_AUTH
	bool "Enable HTTP authentication"
	default y
	depends on HTTPD
	help
	Utilizes password settings from /etc/httpd.conf for basic
	authentication on a per url basis.
	Example for httpd.conf file:
	/adm:toor:PaSsWd

config FEATURE_HTTPD_AUTH_MD5
	bool "Support MD5-encrypted passwords in HTTP authentication"
	default y
	depends on FEATURE_HTTPD_BASIC_AUTH
	help
	Enables encrypted passwords, and wildcard user/passwords
	in httpd.conf file.
	User '*' means 'any system user name is ok',
	password of '*' means 'use system password for this user'
	Examples:
	/adm:toor:$1$P/eKnWXS$aI1aPGxT.dJD5SzqAKWrF0
	/adm:root:*
	/wiki:*:*

config FEATURE_HTTPD_CGI
	bool "Support Common Gateway Interface (CGI)"
	default y
	depends on HTTPD
	help
	This option allows scripts and executables to be invoked
	when specific URLs are requested.

config FEATURE_HTTPD_CONFIG_WITH_SCRIPT_INTERPR
	bool "Support running scripts through an interpreter"
	default y
	depends on FEATURE_HTTPD_CGI
	help
	This option enables support for running scripts through an
	interpreter. Turn this on if you want PHP scripts to work
	properly. You need to supply an additional line in your
	httpd.conf file:
	*.php:/path/to/your/php

config FEATURE_HTTPD_SET_REMOTE_PORT_TO_ENV
	bool "Set REMOTE_PORT environment variable for CGI"
	default y
	depends on FEATURE_HTTPD_CGI
	help
	Use of this option can assist scripts in generating
	references that contain a unique port number.

config FEATURE_HTTPD_ENCODE_URL_STR
	bool "Enable -e option (useful for CGIs written as shell scripts)"
	default y
	depends on HTTPD
	help
	This option allows html encoding of arbitrary strings for display
	by the browser. Output goes to stdout.
	For example, httpd -e "<Hello World>" produces
	"&#60Hello&#32World&#62".

config FEATURE_HTTPD_ERROR_PAGES
	bool "Support custom error pages"
	default y
	depends on HTTPD
	help
	This option allows you to define custom error pages in
	the configuration file instead of the default HTTP status
	error pages. For instance, if you add the line:
		E404:/path/e404.html
	in the config file, the server will respond the specified
	'/path/e404.html' file instead of the terse '404 NOT FOUND'
	message.

config FEATURE_HTTPD_PROXY
	bool "Support reverse proxy"
	default y
	depends on HTTPD
	help
	This option allows you to define URLs that will be forwarded
	to another HTTP server. To setup add the following line to the
	configuration file
		P:/url/:http://hostname[:port]/new/path/
	Then a request to /url/myfile will be forwarded to
	http://hostname[:port]/new/path/myfile.

config FEATURE_HTTPD_GZIP
	bool "Support GZIP content encoding"
	default y
	depends on HTTPD
	help
	Makes httpd send files using GZIP content encoding if the
	client supports it and a pre-compressed <file>.gz exists.
config IFCONFIG
	bool "ifconfig (12 kb)"
	default y
	select PLATFORM_LINUX
	help
	Ifconfig is used to configure the kernel-resident network interfaces.

config FEATURE_IFCONFIG_STATUS
	bool "Enable status reporting output (+7k)"
	default y
	depends on IFCONFIG
	help
	If ifconfig is called with no arguments it will display the status
	of the currently active interfaces.

config FEATURE_IFCONFIG_SLIP
	bool "Enable slip-specific options \"keepalive\" and \"outfill\""
	default y
	depends on IFCONFIG

	planning on using serial lines, leave this unchecked.

config FEATURE_IFCONFIG_MEMSTART_IOADDR_IRQ
	bool "Enable options \"mem_start\", \"io_addr\", and \"irq\""
	default y
	depends on IFCONFIG
	help
	Allow the start address for shared memory, start address for I/O,
	and/or the interrupt line used by the specified device.

config FEATURE_IFCONFIG_HW
	bool "Enable option \"hw\" (ether only)"
	default y
	depends on IFCONFIG
	help
	Set the hardware address of this interface, if the device driver
	supports  this  operation. Currently, we only support the 'ether'
	class.

config FEATURE_IFCONFIG_BROADCAST_PLUS
	bool "Set the broadcast automatically"
	default y
	depends on IFCONFIG
	help
	Setting this will make ifconfig attempt to find the broadcast
	automatically if the value '+' is used.

	default y
	select PLATFORM_LINUX
	help
	Network interface plug detection daemon.
config IFUP
	bool "ifup (14 kb)"
	default y
	help
	Activate the specified interfaces. This applet makes use
	of either "ifconfig" and "route" or the "ip" command to actually
	configure network interfaces. Therefore, you will probably also want
	to enable either IFCONFIG and ROUTE, or enable
	FEATURE_IFUPDOWN_IP and the various IP options. Of
	course you could use non-busybox versions of these programs, so
	against my better judgement (since this will surely result in plenty
	of support questions on the mailing list), I do not force you to
	enable these additional options. It is up to you to supply either
	"ifconfig", "route" and "run-parts" or the "ip" command, either
	via busybox or via standalone utilities.

config IFDOWN
	bool "ifdown (13 kb)"
	default y
	help
	Deactivate the specified interfaces.

config IFUPDOWN_IFSTATE_PATH
	string "Absolute path to ifstate file"
	default "/var/run/ifstate"
	depends on IFUP || IFDOWN
	help
	ifupdown keeps state information in a file called ifstate.
	Typically it is located in /var/run/ifstate, however
	some distributions tend to put it in other places
	(debian, for example, uses /etc/network/run/ifstate).
	This config option defines location of ifstate.

config FEATURE_IFUPDOWN_IP
	bool "Use ip tool (else ifconfig/route is used)"
	default y
	depends on IFUP || IFDOWN
	help
	Use the iproute "ip" command to implement "ifup" and "ifdown", rather
	than the default of using the older "ifconfig" and "route" utilities.

	If Y: you must install either the full-blown iproute2 package
	or enable "ip" applet in busybox, or the "ifup" and "ifdown" applets
	will not work.

	If N: you must install either the full-blown ifconfig and route
	utilities, or enable these applets in busybox.

config FEATURE_IFUPDOWN_IPV4
	bool "Support IPv4"
	default y
	depends on IFUP || IFDOWN
	help
	If you want ifup/ifdown to talk IPv4, leave this on.

	a weird network setup you don't need it.

config FEATURE_IFUPDOWN_EXTERNAL_DHCP
	bool "Support external DHCP clients"
	default n
	depends on IFUP || IFDOWN
	help
	This enables support for the external dhcp clients. Clients are
	tried in the following order: dhcpcd, dhclient, pump and udhcpc.
	Otherwise, if udhcpc applet is enabled, it is used.
	Otherwise, ifup/ifdown will have no support for DHCP.

	default y
	depends on TELNET
	help
	Setting this option will forward the TERM environment variable to the
	remote host you are connecting to. This is useful to make sure that
	things like ANSI colors and other control sequences behave.

config FEATURE_TELNET_AUTOLOGIN
	bool "Pass USER type to remote host"
	default y
	depends on TELNET
	help
	Setting this option will forward the USER environment variable to the
	remote host you are connecting to. This is useful when you need to
	log into a machine without telling the username (autologin). This
	option enables '-a' and '-l USER' options.

config FEATURE_TELNET_WIDTH
	bool "Enable window size autodetection"
	default y
	depends on TELNET
config TELNETD
	bool "telnetd (12 kb)"
	default y
	select FEATURE_SYSLOG
	help
	A daemon for the TELNET protocol, allowing you to log onto the host
	running the daemon. Please keep in mind that the TELNET protocol
	sends passwords in plain text. If you can't afford the space for an
	SSH daemon and you trust your network, you may say 'y' here. As a
	more secure alternative, you should seriously consider installing the
	very small Dropbear SSH daemon instead:
		http://matt.ucc.asn.au/dropbear/dropbear.html

	Note that for busybox telnetd to work you need several things:
	First of all, your kernel needs:
		  CONFIG_UNIX98_PTYS=y

	Next, you need a /dev/pts directory on your root filesystem:

		  $ ls -ld /dev/pts
		  drwxr-xr-x  2 root root 0 Sep 23 13:21 /dev/pts/

	Next you need the pseudo terminal master multiplexer /dev/ptmx:

		  $ ls -la /dev/ptmx
		  crw-rw-rw-  1 root tty 5, 2 Sep 23 13:55 /dev/ptmx

	Any /dev/ttyp[0-9]* files you may have can be removed.
	Next, you need to mount the devpts filesystem on /dev/pts using:

		  mount -t devpts devpts /dev/pts

	You need to be sure that busybox has LOGIN and
	FEATURE_SUID enabled. And finally, you should make
	certain that busybox has been installed setuid root:

		chown root.root /bin/busybox
		chmod 4755 /bin/busybox

	with all that done, telnetd _should_ work....

config FEATURE_TELNETD_STANDALONE
	bool "Support standalone telnetd (not inetd only)"
	default y
	depends on TELNETD
	help
	Selecting this will make telnetd able to run standalone.

config FEATURE_TELNETD_INETD_WAIT
	bool "Support -w SEC option (inetd wait mode)"
	default y
	depends on FEATURE_TELNETD_STANDALONE
	help
	This option allows you to run telnetd in "inet wait" mode.
	Example inetd.conf line (note "wait", not usual "nowait"):

	telnet stream tcp wait root /bin/telnetd telnetd -w10

	In this example, inetd passes _listening_ socket_ as fd 0
	to telnetd when connection appears.
	telnetd will wait for connections until all existing
	connections are closed, and no new connections
	appear during 10 seconds. Then it exits, and inetd continues
	to listen for new connections.

	This option is rarely used. "tcp nowait" is much more usual
	way of running tcp services, including telnetd.
	You most probably want to say N here.
config TFTP
	bool "tftp (11 kb)"
	default y
	help
	Trivial File Transfer Protocol client. TFTP is usually used
	for simple, small transfers such as a root image

	Trivial File Transfer Protocol server.
	It expects that stdin is a datagram socket and a packet
	is already pending on it. It will exit after one transfer.
	In other words: it should be run from inetd in nowait mode,
	or from udpsvd. Example: "udpsvd -E 0 69 tftpd DIR"

config FEATURE_TFTP_GET
	bool "Enable 'tftp get' and/or tftpd upload code"
	default y
	depends on TFTP || TFTPD
	help
	Add support for the GET command within the TFTP client. This allows
	a client to retrieve a file from a TFTP server.
	Also enable upload support in tftpd, if tftpd is selected.

	Note: this option does _not_ make tftpd capable of download
	(the usual operation people need from it)!

config FEATURE_TFTP_PUT
	bool "Enable 'tftp put' and/or tftpd download code"
	default y
	depends on TFTP || TFTPD
	help
	Add support for the PUT command within the TFTP client. This allows

config FEATURE_WGET_TIMEOUT
	bool "Enable timeout option -T SEC"
	default y
	depends on WGET
	help
	Supports network read and connect timeouts for wget,
	so that wget will give up and timeout, through the -T
	command line option.

	Currently only connect and network data read timeout are
	supported (i.e., timeout is not applied to the DNS query). When
	FEATURE_WGET_LONG_OPTIONS is also enabled, the --timeout option
	will work in addition to -T.

config FEATURE_WGET_HTTPS
	bool "Support HTTPS using internal TLS code"
	default y
	depends on WGET
	select TLS
	help
	wget will use internal TLS code to connect to https:// URLs.
	Note:
	On NOMMU machines, ssl_helper applet should be available
	in the $PATH for this to work. Make sure to select that applet.

	Note: currently, TLS code only makes TLS I/O work, it
	does *not* check that the peer is who it claims to be, etc.
	IOW: it uses peer-supplied public keys to establish encryption
	and signing keys, then encrypts and signs outgoing data and
	decrypts incoming data.
	It does not check signature hashes on the incoming data:
	this means that attackers manipulating TCP packets can
	send altered data and we unknowingly receive garbage.
	(This check might be relatively easy to add).
	It does not check public key's certificate:
	this means that the peer may be an attacker impersonating
	the server we think we are talking to.

	If you think this is unacceptable, consider this. As more and more
	servers switch to HTTPS-only operation, without such "crippled"
	TLS code it is *impossible* to simply download a kernel source
	from kernel.org. Which can in real world translate into
	"my small automatic tooling to build cross-compilers from sources
	no longer works, I need to additionally keep a local copy
	of ~4 megabyte source tarball of a SSL library and ~2 megabyte
	source of wget, need to compile and built both before I can
	download anything. All this despite the fact that the build
	is done in a QEMU sandbox on a machine with absolutely nothing
	worth stealing, so I don't care if someone would go to a lot
	of trouble to intercept my HTTPS download to send me an altered
	kernel tarball".

	If you still think this is unacceptable, send patches.

	If you still think this is unacceptable, do not want to send
	patches, but do want to waste bandwidth expaining how wrong
	it is, you will be ignored.

	FEATURE_WGET_OPENSSL does implement TLS verification
	using the certificates available to OpenSSL.

config FEATURE_WGET_OPENSSL
	bool "Try to connect to HTTPS using openssl"
	default y
	depends on WGET
	help
	Try to use openssl to handle HTTPS.

	OpenSSL has a simple SSL client for debug purposes.
	If you select this option, wget will effectively run:
	"openssl s_client -quiet -connect hostname:443
	-servername hostname 2>/dev/null" and pipe its data
	through it. -servername is not used if hostname is numeric.
	Note inconvenient API: host resolution is done twice,
	and there is no guarantee openssl's idea of IPv6 address
	format is the same as ours.
	Another problem is that s_client prints debug information
	to stderr, and it needs to be suppressed. This means
	all error messages get suppressed too.
	openssl is also a big binary, often dynamically linked
	against ~15 libraries.

	If openssl can't be executed, internal TLS code will be used
	(if you enabled it); if openssl can be executed but fails later,
	wget can't detect this, and download will fail.

	By default TLS verification is performed, unless
	--no-check-certificate option is passed.
config WHOIS
	bool "whois (6.3 kb)"
