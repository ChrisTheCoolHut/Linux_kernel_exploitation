config BOOTCHARTD
	bool "bootchartd (10 kb)"
	default y
	help
	bootchartd is commonly used to profile the boot process
	for the purpose of speeding it up. In this case, it is started
	by the kernel as the init process. This is configured by adding
	the init=/sbin/bootchartd option to the kernel command line.

	It can also be used to monitor the resource usage of a specific
	application or the running system in general. In this case,
	bootchartd is started interactively by running bootchartd start
	and stopped using bootchartd stop.

config FEATURE_BOOTCHARTD_BLOATED_HEADER
	bool "Compatible, bloated header"
	default y
	depends on BOOTCHARTD
	help
	Create extended header file compatible with "big" bootchartd.
	"Big" bootchartd is a shell script and it dumps some
	"convenient" info into the header, such as:
		title = Boot chart for `hostname` (`date`)
		system.uname = `uname -srvm`
		system.release = `cat /etc/DISTRO-release`
		system.cpu = `grep '^model name' /proc/cpuinfo | head -1` ($cpucount)
		system.kernel.options = `cat /proc/cmdline`
	This data is not mandatory for bootchart graph generation,
	and is considered bloat. Nevertheless, this option
	makes bootchartd applet to dump a subset of it.

config FEATURE_BOOTCHARTD_CONFIG_FILE
	bool "Support bootchartd.conf"
	default y
	depends on BOOTCHARTD
	help
	Enable reading and parsing of $PWD/bootchartd.conf
	and /etc/bootchartd.conf files.
config HALT
	bool "halt (4 kb)"
	default y
	help
	Stop all processes and halt the system.

config POWEROFF
	bool "poweroff (4 kb)"
	default y
	help
	Stop all processes and power off the system.

config REBOOT
	bool "reboot (4 kb)"
	default y
	help
	Stop all processes and reboot the system.

config FEATURE_WAIT_FOR_INIT
	bool "Before signaling init, make sure it is ready for it"
	default y
	depends on HALT || POWEROFF || REBOOT
	help
	In rare cases, poweroff may be commanded by firmware to OS
	even before init process exists. On Linux, this spawns
	"/sbin/poweroff" very early. This option adds code
	which checks that init is ready to receive poweroff
	commands. Code size increase of ~80 bytes.

config FEATURE_CALL_TELINIT
	bool "Call telinit on shutdown and reboot"
	default y
	depends on (HALT || POWEROFF || REBOOT) && !INIT
	help
	Call an external program (normally telinit) to facilitate
	a switch to a proper runlevel.

	This option is only available if you selected halt and friends,
	but did not select init.

config TELINIT_PATH
	string "Path to telinit executable"
	default "/sbin/telinit"
	depends on FEATURE_CALL_TELINIT
	help
	When busybox halt and friends have to call external telinit
	to facilitate proper shutdown, this path is to be used when
	locating telinit executable.
config INIT
	bool "init (10 kb)"
	default y
	select FEATURE_SYSLOG
	help
	init is the first program run when the system boots.

config LINUXRC
	bool "linuxrc: support running init from initrd (not initramfs)"
	default y
	select FEATURE_SYSLOG
	help
	Legacy support for running init under the old-style initrd. Allows
	the name linuxrc to act as init, and it doesn't assume init is PID 1.

	This does not apply to initramfs, which runs /init as PID 1 and
	requires no special support.

config FEATURE_USE_INITTAB
	bool "Support reading an inittab file"
	default y
	depends on INIT || LINUXRC
	help
	Allow init to read an inittab file when the system boot.

config FEATURE_KILL_REMOVED
	bool "Support killing processes that have been removed from inittab"
	default n
	depends on FEATURE_USE_INITTAB
	help
	When respawn entries are removed from inittab and a SIGHUP is
	sent to init, this option will make init kill the processes
	that have been removed.

config FEATURE_KILL_DELAY
	int "How long to wait between TERM and KILL (0 - send TERM only)" if FEATURE_KILL_REMOVED
	range 0 1024
	default 0
	depends on FEATURE_KILL_REMOVED
	help
	With nonzero setting, init sends TERM, forks, child waits N
	seconds, sends KILL and exits. Setting it too high is unwise
	(child will hang around for too long and could actually kill
	the wrong process!)

config FEATURE_INIT_SCTTY
	bool "Run commands with leading dash with controlling tty"
	default y
	depends on INIT || LINUXRC
	help
	If this option is enabled, init will try to give a controlling
	tty to any command which has leading hyphen (often it's "-/bin/sh").
	More precisely, init will do "ioctl(STDIN_FILENO, TIOCSCTTY, 0)".
	If device attached to STDIN_FILENO can be a ctty but is not yet
	a ctty for other session, it will become this process' ctty.
	This is not the traditional init behavour, but is often what you want
	in an embedded system where the console is only accessed during
	development or for maintenance.
	NB: using cttyhack applet may work better.

config FEATURE_INIT_SYSLOG
	bool "Enable init to write to syslog"
	default y
	depends on INIT || LINUXRC
	help
	If selected, some init messages are sent to syslog.
	Otherwise, they are sent to VT #5 if linux virtual tty is detected
	(if not, no separate logging is done).

config FEATURE_INIT_QUIET
	bool "Be quiet on boot (no 'init started:' message)"
	default y
	depends on INIT || LINUXRC

config FEATURE_INIT_COREDUMPS
	bool "Support dumping core for child processes (debugging only)"
	default n	# not Y because this is a debug option
	depends on INIT || LINUXRC
	help
	If this option is enabled and the file /.init_enable_core
	exists, then init will call setrlimit() to allow unlimited
	core file sizes. If this option is disabled, processes
	will not generate any core files.

config INIT_TERMINAL_TYPE
	string "Initial terminal type"
	default "linux"
	depends on INIT || LINUXRC
	help
	This is the initial value set by init for the TERM environment
	variable. This variable is used by programs which make use of
	extended terminal capabilities.

	Note that on Linux, init attempts to detect serial terminal and
	sets TERM to "vt102" if one is found.

config FEATURE_INIT_MODIFY_CMDLINE
	bool "Clear init's command line"
	default y
	depends on INIT || LINUXRC
	help
	When launched as PID 1 and after parsing its arguments, init
	wipes all the arguments but argv[0] and rewrites argv[0] to
	contain only "init", so that its command line appears solely as
	"init" in tools such as ps.
	If this option is set to Y, init will keep its original behavior,
	otherwise, all the arguments including argv[0] will be preserved,
	be they parsed or ignored by init.
	The original command-line used to launch init can then be
	retrieved in /proc/1/cmdline on Linux, for example.
