	bool "ar (9.5 kb)"
	default n  # needs to be improved to be able to replace binutils ar
	help
	ar is an archival utility program used to create, modify, and
	extract contents from archives. In practice, it is used exclusively
	for object module archives used by compilers.

	Unless you have a specific application which requires ar, you should
	probably say N here: most compilers come with their own ar utility.

config FEATURE_AR_LONG_FILENAMES
	bool "Support long filenames (not needed for debs)"
	default y
	depends on AR
	help
	By default the ar format can only store the first 15 characters
	of the filename, this option removes that limitation.
	It supports the GNU ar long filename method which moves multiple long
	filenames into a the data section of a new ar entry.

config FEATURE_AR_CREATE
	bool "Support archive creation"
	default y
	depends on AR
	help
	This enables archive creation (-c and -r) with busybox ar.

	bool "bzip2 (16 kb)"
	default y
	help
	bzip2 is a compression utility using the Burrows-Wheeler block
	sorting text compression algorithm, and Huffman coding. Compression
	is generally considerably better than that achieved by more
